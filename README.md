# partial-session-types-prototype
Proof-of-concept implementation in OCaml of a proposed merging algorithm for partial session types.
This prototype is intended as an artefact for an article submitted at the CONCUR 2020 conference called "Composable Partial Multiparty Session Types".

## Required softwares:
The standard ocaml tools, including ocamlbuild, ocamllex, and ocamlyacc.

## How to
- Run `make`
- Launch `ocaml`
- Type `Ex1.run ();;`
- Type `Ex2.run ();;`
- Type `Ex3.run ();;`
- You can also test the different implemented functions.

The different .ml files have self-explanatory names. You can also look at the *.mli files and at the .ocamlinit file.
